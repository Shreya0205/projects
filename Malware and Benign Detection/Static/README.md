Requirements.txt file:
It contains the libaries to be install.

static.py
- Code to extract features from the files. It will ask for the directory path which contains static information.
- It will create static.csv which

### To install all dependencies, run command:
- make

### To run the python code, run command:
- make execute

(code can also be run using "python static.py" )
 
1. It will ask for the directory path/Name (Enter Directory Path:) in which all the static information of files is present.
2. It creates static.csv file which contains classification of files.
3. It creates features.csv which contains extracted features.

### To clean the files, run command:
- make clean
( It will delete files which are created in between the execution and also "static.csv" )

### Extracted Features are
