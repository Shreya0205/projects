Requirements.txt file:
It contains the libaries to be install.

static.py
- Code to extract features from the files. It will ask for the directory path/Name which contains json files.
- It will create static.csv which

### To install all dependencies, run command:
- make

### To run the python code, run command:
- make execute

(code can also be run using python dynamic.py) 
1. It will ask for the directory path/Name (Enter Directory Path:) in which all the dynamic information of files is present.
2. It creates dynamic.csv file which contains classification of files.
3. It creates features.csv which contains extracted features.
4. Extracted Features are

Network Features:
